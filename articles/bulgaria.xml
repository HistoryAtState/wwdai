                <p>New legislation may change the current law soon, but will most likely improve
                    access rather than inhibit it. Currently, materials prior to 1944 are found at
                    the Central State Archives. For materials after 1944, researchers are advised to
                    contact the Diplomatic Archives at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The early
                    period has been reviewed and declassified. The process for later years is
                    on-going, though unclassified documents are accessible. </p>

                    However, it has produced individual volumes elaborating particular themes in
                    Bulgarian History.</p>
