                <p>The Foreign Ministry of Ecuador is developing a system for declassification and
                    organization of its archives. Unclassified documents are available to the public
                    at the archives at the Foreign Ministry. Currently, classified historical
                    documents will be available after a period of 40 years. (The Foreign Ministry
                    was created in 1980). There is an appeal process, though requests are rare.</p>
