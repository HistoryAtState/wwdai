                <p>Access to the National Archives is governed by the National Archives Act of 1986
                    and the Freedom of Information Act of 1997. All Government Departmental records
                    which are more than 30 years old must be transferred to the National Archives
                    and made available for inspection by the public with exceptions for records that
                    are contrary to the public interest. The Freedom of Information Act gives
                    members of the public the right to request access to unavailable documents.</p>

                <p>Researchers must acquire a Reader’s Ticket to access the archives. This can be
                    done by visiting the archives and presenting a photo ID. Members of the public
                    may just present themselves in person to the Archives. However, the Archives’
                    staff recommends that researchers contact them ahead of time in order to
                    expedite the process of ordering files. Additionally, there is an on-line search
                    engine.</p>
