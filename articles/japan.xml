                <p>According to a law passed in 1976, documents can be disclosed to the public after
                    30 years. In practice, the Diplomatic Record Office (opened in 1971) publishes
                    collections of documents on a schedule that is supposed to follow that 30 year
                    line, but in fact materials are published at an uneven rate. As of 2005, the DRO
                    had published 19 sets of documents, with the latest set covering the years
                    1951-1976. Documents from the mid-19th century until 1945 are available to be
                    viewed at the DRO, also according to law.</p>

                    including an institutional I.D. There are finding aids for all materials at the
                    DRO. There is no fee to access the collections. </p>
