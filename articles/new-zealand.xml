                <p>The Public Records Act of 2005 stipulates that all documents at 25 years must be
                    classified as either open access or restricted access. Additionally, the
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade offers a limited number of grants for
                    historical research. Preference will be given to research on the development of
                    New Zealand’s foreign relations in the period from the Second World War onwards,
                    and to work which draws on the Ministry’s archival records. </p>

                <p> The holdings of the National Archives are spread out over New Zealand, though
                    most are housed at the Head Office in Wellington. As such, it is a good idea to
                    contact the Archives before visiting. </p>
