                <p> There are two important laws governing access to National Archives. The 1983 Act
                    on National Archives and the 1999 Act on the Protection of Classified
                    Information. Documents are generally made accessible to the public after 30
                    years, though this does not apply to documents marked as secret. The Foreign
                    Minister may give permission to view documents that are under 30 years old as
                    long as they are not marked as secret. Secret material may be declassified after
                    50 years. </p>
