                <p>Records in the custody of the National Archives of Singapore are available to the
                    public after 25 years. Certain national acts such as the Privacy Act, Population
                    Census Act and Income tax Act may prevent the release of certain records. The
                    National Archives has a declassification committee who reviews sensitive public
                    archives for release. </p>
