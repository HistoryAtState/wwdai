                <p> The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no systematic way to dealing with requests
                    for files, and requests are sent from the Ministry of Information to the
                    individual offices concerned. The Government of Togo does not receive many
                    requests for access to diplomatic archives, so there has been little pressing
                    need to organize a system. Requests are considered on a case by case basis
                    depending on the sensitivity of the issue and the time period involved.
                    Diplomatic archives for the colonial period are available at the National
                    Library. </p>

                <p> For pre-independence inquiries, researchers should contact the National Library.
                    For post-independence requests, researchers must write to the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs. </p>
