                <p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry is currently developing a system to catalogue its
                    archives, so there is no cache of declassified or unclassified documents.
                    However, Turkey has a Law on Right to Information that went into effect in 2004
                    that gives researchers the right to request access to diplomatic records. Also,
                    the Ottoman State Archives (pre 1923) are open to research. </p>

                <p>The Directorate of Republican Archives and the Directorate of Documentation are
                    based in Ankara. The Directorate of Ottoman Archives is based in Istanbul. </p>

                <p>From abroad, foreign researchers should contact the Turkish Embassy in their own
                    countries to apply for a research visa and access to archives. In Turkey, local
                    and foreign researchers may apply in person.</p>
